                  <p>For winter 2019, we'll work out your payment during the week
                     of 16 to 22 September 2020. This is called the 'qualifying week'.</p>

            <p>Based on your answers, you'll get £100 because you'll be under 80 and
              living with someone of State Pension age during qualifying week.</p>

            <p>You do not need to claim your Winter Fuel Payment and you'll get it every year.</p>
