            <br>

            <p>You qualify for £200 because you were born before 6 October 1954 and get one of these benefits:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Pension Credit</li>
            <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)</li>
            <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
            <li>Income Support</li>
          </ul>

           <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h3>
           <p>Your payment will usually be made in November or December, but may take until the following 31 March.</p>
           <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p>This will happen automatically. You do not need to make a claim.</p>
         </div>
           <p>If you live with someone who also gets one of these benefits, only one of you will get the payment.</p>

           <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Changes of circumstance</h3>
           <p>If your circumstances change, it could affect what you are entitled to. For example:</p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
             <li>moving house or there is a change to who you live with</li>
             <li>being in hospital for more than a year</li>
             <li>moving into a care home</li>
           </ul>

           <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p>You should tell us about any change of circumstances as soon as possible.</p>
