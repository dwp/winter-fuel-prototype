                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

                <p>Most payments will be made in November and December 2019. However, payments
                  can still be made up until 13 January 2020.</p>

                <p>Once a person has received a Winter Fuel Payment they will continue to get
                  a payment every year without having to make another claim.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Changes of circumstance</h3>
                <p>How much a person gets depends on their circumstances during the qualifying week.
                  The qualifying week for winter 2020 is 16 to 22 September 2020.</p>
                <p>
                We need to know as soon as possible if Theodora Best:
