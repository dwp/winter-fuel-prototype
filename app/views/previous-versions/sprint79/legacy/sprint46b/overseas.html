            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> If the citizen is not living in the UK, calculate eligibility as usual and make the following changes to the final page:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>add the word "may" to the green panel</li>
              <li>add the word "may" to the first paragraph</li>

              <li>replace all content following the list of eligibility reasons</li>

            <br>

          <p>You may qualify for £200 because you:</p>

               <li>were born before 6 October 1954</li>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Because you live outside the UK</h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Not everyone who lives outside the UK can get a Winter Fuel Payment.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">You might still get the payment if you live in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">You need to have a genuine and sufficient link to the UK - this can include having lived or worked in the UK, and having family in the UK.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            You cannot get the payment if you live in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta,
            Portugal or Spain because the average winter temperature there is higher than the warmest
            region of the UK.
