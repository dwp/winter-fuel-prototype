                   We work out your Winter Fuel Payment based on your circumstances during the week of 19 to 25 September 2022.<br><br>
                   Some of the following questions will ask you what you think your circumstances will be during that week. For example, where you think you'll be living and who you think you'll be living with.<br><br>
                   If your actual circumstances during the week of 19 to 25 September 2022 turn out to be different:                  
                    <ul>
                      <li>you might get a different amount for your Winter Fuel Payment, or</li>
                      <li>you might not qualify for a payment at all</li>
