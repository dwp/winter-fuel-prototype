            <p>For winter 2019, we worked out your payment during the week of 16
                     to 22 September 2020. This is called the 'qualifying week'.</p>

            <p>You qualify for £100 because you were under 80 years old and living with someone
              who was also getting Pension Credit during qualifying week.</p>
