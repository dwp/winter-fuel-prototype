          <p>For winter 2020, we worked out payments during the week
             of 21 to 27 September 2020. This is called the 'qualifying week'.</p>

          <p>You do not qualify because you were getting Pension Credit and
            living in a care home for 13 weeks or more, including qualifying week.</p>
